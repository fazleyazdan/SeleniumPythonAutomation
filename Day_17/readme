==> Data Driven Testing : in data driven testing , testing are driven by data:

==> meaning the same test case is run multiple times by changing the data

==> most of the times we read data for test cases from the database or excel sheet. 

==> selenium by default does not work with excel. it is solely used for automation

==> we have to install a library for that called "openpyxl"

==> this library works only with .xlsx extensions
